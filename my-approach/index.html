<p>Taking the first steps towards addressing your problems can be intimidating.  I work from a collaborative, non-judgmental, and empathetic perspective. We may all live in the same world, but our unique individual experiences shape who we are, and how we approach events in our lives. In therapy, I strive to understand your unique world, and to work with you to deepen your understanding of your struggles. I do this by working with you to create a supportive, trusting, and safe therapeutic relationship through which difficult thoughts and feelings related to your struggles can be explored and understood more fully. This new understanding allows you to enact changes and improvements.</p>

<p>My individualized and collaborative approach allows me to treat people as the individuals that they are, rather than a diagnosis. No two treatments look the same, but my clinical decisions are guided by experience, consultation, and contemporary research.</p>

<p>I have a wide range of experiences with a variety of people and the problems they face. By working with you, I hope to make therapy a positive, powerful, and transformative experience which can improve your life.</p>
