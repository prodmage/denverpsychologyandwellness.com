	<h3>Dr. John Bodycombe</h3>
	<p class="center">Are you struggling with feeling overwhelmed, lost, or unsatisfied in your life?  Do these feelings impact your mood, your relationships, or your work?  I specialize in helping adults and emerging adults (18-50s) people work through these sorts of challenges.  These challenges can often result in feelings of depression and anxiety, or can come through in our relationships through short tempers, seeming "clingy," or wanting to be alone.  I can help you work through these issues in order to improve your quality of life and work toward your goals.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>I also specialize in working with men.  Men often learn to internalize their issues which can make them feel isolated and lost.  Additionally, seeking help may feel like weakness or failure.  By helping men connect to themselves better, I can help them improve their relationships and improve their lives.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>Finally, I have extensive experience in working with trauma.  Have you experienced something which left you feeling shaken?  Have you experienced reoccurring nightmares about an event, or do you notice feeling panicky when something reminds you of this difficult experience?  Trauma can affect anyone, and it can be debilitating long after the event actually occurred.  Nothing can change the experiences you have gone through but by working through your traumatic experience in therapy, you can change the way that experience affects you moving forward.
