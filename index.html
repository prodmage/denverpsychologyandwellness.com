	<h3>Dr. John Bodycombe</h3>
	<p class="center">Developing trust and safety with another person is a process.  It is hard to open up about your experiences, your thoughts, and your feelings with close friends, let alone a therapist.  Because of this it is important that you choose to work with someone who you feel "gets you."  Therapy can be a powerful process which helps us to deal with the difficulties that we face in our lives.  It can facilitate growth, acceptance, and it can increase our knowledge of ourselves and the world around us.  I work to provide a safe, confidential, and trusting environment in which I can come to know you and help you explore your path and the obstacles you are facing. </p>
