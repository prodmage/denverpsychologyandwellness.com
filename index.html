	<h3>Dr. John Bodycombe</h3>
	<p class="center">Are you struggling with feeling overwhelmed, lost, or unsatisfied in your life?  Do these feelings impact your mood, your relationships, or your work?  I specialize in helping adults and emerging adults (18-50s) people work through these sorts of challenges that we all face at different times in our lives.  Often, these challenges can result if feelings of depression and anxiety, or they come through in our relationships through short tempers, seeming "clingy," or wanting to be alone.  I can help you work through these issues in order to improve your quality of life and work toward the goals you have for yourself.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>I also specialize in working with men.  Men often learn to internalize their issues which can make them feel isolated and lost.  Additionally, seeking help may feel like weakness or failure.  By helping men connect to themselves better, I can help them improve their relationships and improve their lives.</p>
