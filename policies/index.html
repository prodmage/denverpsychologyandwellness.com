	<h4>What does a therapy session cost?</h4>
	<p>One of the most important factors in beginning therapy is the "match" between you and your therapist.  Because of this, I offer a free 50-minute initial consulation session.  This is a chance for you to determine whether I am someone who you feel comfortable talking to and will be able to help you.  At the same time, I will have the opportunity to learn more about the problems your are facing, and to determine if I am the best person to help.</p>

	<p>After this initial consultation, my regular fee for a 50-minute therapy session is $150. I believe that finances alone should not be a barrier to receiving therapy however, and I am sometimes able to offer a sliding scale to clients that do not have the financial resources to pay my full fee. Please call me to learn more about this option.</p>

	<h4>Will insurance pay for my therapy?</h4>
	<p>I do not accept insurance but my fee can sometimes be reimbursed if you have a plan that covers out-of-network providers.  I am happy to prepare a monthly or weekly statement for you to submit to your insurance provider.</p>

	<h4>Cancellation Policy</h4>
	<p>I request that you notify me at least 48-hours in advance if you need to cancel a scheduled therapy session.  This is because when I reserve a time for you, I make that time unavailable to my other clients.  I charge the full session fee if you fail to give me the required 48-hour notice. </p>
