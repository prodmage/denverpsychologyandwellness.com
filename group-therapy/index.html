<h3>Emerging Adults Group</h3>
<p>Are you an adult in your twenties or thirties who struggles to develop the kind of relationships you want? Do you struggle to express yourself or feel you get trapped in the same patterns over and over? Our group focuses on helping group members learn about their behavior in relationships and is most helpful for people who desire to learn and grow through feedback and experimenting with taking interpersonal risks. These risks allow members to connect more deeply, share their true thoughts and feelings, and integrate feedback from both co-facilitators and other group members.</p>
<p> To learn more about this group and to have a free initial consultation please contact me at {{ site.email}} or call me at {{ site.phone_number }}.
